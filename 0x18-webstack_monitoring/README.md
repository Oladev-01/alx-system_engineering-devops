# WEBSTACK MONITORING

## Introduction

The **WEBSTACK MONITORING** project integrates Datadog monitoring services to effectively track and manage the performance and availability of server infrastructure. By leveraging Datadog's comprehensive monitoring capabilities, this project aims to provide real-time insights into system health, application performance, and user experience.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuously monitor server performance metrics, including CPU usage, memory utilization, disk I/O, and network traffic.
- **Application Performance Monitoring (APM):** Track application performance, identify bottlenecks, and ensure optimal response times.
- **Alerting and Notifications:** Set up alerts for critical issues, enabling prompt responses to system anomalies and downtimes.
- **Dashboards and Visualization:** Create custom dashboards to visualize key metrics and monitor system status at a glance.
- **Log Management:** Centralize log collection and analysis to troubleshoot issues and improve system performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A [Datadog account](https://www.datadoghq.com/). If you don't have one, sign up to get started.
- Access to your servers for installing the Datadog Agent.

### Installation

#### 1. Install the Datadog Agent

To begin monitoring your servers, you need to install the Datadog Agent. The installation process varies depending on your operating system.

##### For Linux

```sh
DD_AGENT_MAJOR_VERSION=7 DD_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> bash -c "$(curl -L https://s3.amazonaws.com/dd-agent/scripts/install_script.sh)"
```

##### For Windows

1. Download the Datadog Agent installer from the [Datadog Agent download page](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent/windows).
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts. Enter your API key when prompted.

##### For macOS

```sh
brew install datadog-agent
```

Replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with your Datadog API key. This key can be found in the Datadog web interface under **Integrations** > **APIs**.

#### 2. Configure the Datadog Agent

After installation, the Datadog Agent can be configured to monitor specific services and applications. Configuration files can be found in the following locations:

- **Linux:** `/etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml`
- **Windows:** `C:\ProgramData\Datadog\datadog.yaml`
- **macOS:** `/usr/local/etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml`

Edit the `datadog.yaml` file to specify additional configuration settings, such as integrations and log collection.

### Usage

#### Monitoring Your Servers

Once the Datadog Agent is installed and configured, it will automatically begin collecting metrics and reporting them to the Datadog platform. You can log in to your Datadog account and navigate to the **Infrastructure** tab to view your monitored hosts and services.

#### Setting Up Dashboards

Create custom dashboards to visualize key metrics and monitor the health of your infrastructure. You can add various widgets such as graphs, monitors, and heatmaps to your dashboards.

#### Alerts and Notifications

Set up alerts to receive notifications when specific metrics exceed predefined thresholds. This helps in quickly identifying and addressing potential issues. Alerts can be configured under the **Monitors** tab in the Datadog web interface.
