# 0x12. Web Stack Debugging #2

## Introduction

Welcome to the **0x12. Web Stack Debugging #2** project! This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering program and aims to introduce students to various techniques and tools for debugging issues that may arise in web stack development. Effective debugging is a crucial skill for software engineers, and this project will help you develop a systematic approach to identifying and fixing problems in web applications.

## Objectives

- Understand the common issues that can occur in a web stack.
- Learn how to use different debugging tools and techniques.
- Develop a systematic approach to troubleshooting and fixing issues.
- Gain hands-on experience with real-world debugging scenarios.

## Requirements

- All tasks must be done on a server provided by ALX.
- You must use the Bash scripting language.
- Scripts should be executed without errors.
- Each script should be well-documented.
- Ensure your scripts are readable and maintainable.

## Debugging Tools and Techniques

- **Log Analysis:** Check log files for error messages and clues.
  - Nginx: `/var/log/nginx/error.log`
  - Apache: `/var/log/apache2/error.log`
  - System: `/var/log/syslog`

- **Configuration Review:** Ensure configuration files are set up correctly.
  - Nginx: `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`
  - Apache: `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf`

- **Process Management:** Check running processes and their statuses.
  - `ps aux | grep <process_name>`
  - `top`

- **Networking:** Verify network configurations and connectivity.
  - `netstat -tuln`
  - `curl -I http://localhost`
