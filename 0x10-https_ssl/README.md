## Introduction

This project is part of the ALX curriculum, focusing on understanding and implementing HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure), SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), and TLS (Transport Layer Security). The main objective is to secure web traffic between clients and servers by encrypting communication and ensuring data integrity.

## Project Objectives

The key objectives of this project are:

1. **Understand HTTPS**: Learn the importance of HTTPS in securing web traffic.
2. **Implement SSL/TLS**: Configure web servers to use SSL/TLS certificates for encryption.
3. **Certificate Management**: Learn to generate, install, and manage SSL/TLS certificates.
4. **Subdomain Configuration**: Configure multiple subdomains to serve content over HTTPS.
5. **Automate Configuration**: Write scripts to automate the setup and management of HTTPS and SSL/TLS on web servers.

## Requirements

- A domain name for your project.
- Access to a web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) for configuring HTTPS.
- Basic knowledge of Bash scripting.
- Familiarity with DNS and subdomain configuration.

## Getting Started

1. **Domain Configuration**:
   - Add the following subdomains and point them to the appropriate IP addresses:
     - `www` -> Points to `lb-01` IP
     - `lb-01` -> Points to `lb-01` IP
     - `web-01` -> Points to `web-01` IP
     - `web-02` -> Points to `web-02` IP

2. **Install Necessary Packages**:
   - Update your package list and install necessary packages:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get -y install nginx openssl
     ```

3. **Generate SSL/TLS Certificates**:
   - Generate a self-signed SSL certificate or obtain one from a Certificate Authority (CA).
     ```bash
     sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt
     ```

4. **Configure Web Server**:
   - Edit your web server configuration to use the SSL/TLS certificate.
     ```bash
     sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
     ```

5. **Restart Web Server**:
   - Restart your web server to apply the changes.
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart nginx
     ```

## Usage

- **Automated Script**:
  - Run the provided Bash script to automate the configuration of your web server for HTTPS.
  - Ensure the script accepts the required domain and subdomain parameters.

- **Manual Configuration**:
  - Follow the steps in the Getting Started section to manually configure your web server.

## Key Concepts

### HTTPS

- **HTTPS**: An extension of HTTP that uses SSL/TLS to encrypt data between clients and servers.

### SSL/TLS

- **SSL**: Secure Sockets Layer, a protocol for establishing authenticated and encrypted links between networked computers.
- **TLS**: Transport Layer Security, the successor to SSL, offering improved security and performance.

### Certificates

- **SSL/TLS Certificates**: Digital certificates used to establish a secure connection between a client and a server.

### Subdomains

- **Subdomains**: Domains that are part of a larger domain, used to organize and navigate different sections of a website.
